# Unweighted and Weighted Polling Analyser



The goal of this application is to produce the data necessary for my 2022 election graphs, i.e. the dots, lines and areas. This system will produce the data for bot the weighted and unweighted polling. The to do list is as follows:

Done: 

- Primary Vote Data
- Conf Intervals for all parties in the primary vote
- Program Foundation - argument parsers and file locations

TODO:

- TPP Vote Data
- Conf Intervals for TPP
- Leadership and Shadow Leadership Satisfaction & Dissatisfaction data 
- Conf intervals for leadership
- Preferred Prime minister / conf interval for preferred prime minister
- Weight the polls based on house effect
- Weight polls based on online vs online - telephone etc (Need to see if online polling has an exaggerated effect on the data since its heavily used in the leadup to the 2022 election)
